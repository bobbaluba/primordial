PROGRAMMING

You need Code::Blocks to compile, it should work under both linux and windows,
only tested on Windows so far

Controls...
Move: WASD
Rotate camera: Arrow keys

The most important code is lines 19-22 in file "src/mechanics.cpp":

    ///                 Model,      Position,               Direction
    scene->addProp(     "sphere",   vec3(0.0, 0.0, -2.0),   vec3(0.0, 0.0, -1.0));
    scene->addProp(     "quad",     vec3(3.0, 0.0, -2.0),   vec3(0.0, 0.0, -1.0));
    scene->addProp(     "quad",     vec3(-3.0, 0.0, -2.0),   vec3(0.0, 0.0, -1.0));
