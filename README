special note:

ART

The most interesting art asset is "mdl_human_male.blend" which is a "makehuman"-model
with a few animations.

Coming up:
Idle combat animation,
more combat animations!

Known issues:
		When deleting the "floor", objects which rested
		on it do not fall down, since they are not "activated"
		by the physics engine.
