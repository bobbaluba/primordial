current work flow is terrible: Here is what needs to be done to get 
a model from blender to produce a game-compatible file:

1. Animate
2. make a copy of .blend file and bake using "constraintbake.py"
3. go into blender and add keyframes to all channels to
   all frames containing key-frames
4. import "bones_export_test.py" and change the action name 
   in the script to correspond with the model.
5. Copy and rename the produced file into resources/animations
   directory.

suggestions for improvement: Make the game handle different
keyframe locations for different channels. 

Models:

1. Apply transforms, finish skinning, recalculate normals etc
2. Make a copy and triangulate all faces
3. run the script "export_verts.py" on it (edit the names to match
   in the script)
5. Make sure the model is in rest pose
4. Export as OBJ, make sure to include 
   normals and texture coordinates (keep vertex order! for weights)
   also make sure "Triangulate" is checked.
5. Open the output of "export_verts.py" ("Cube.obj") and copy-paste
   all lines starting with "w" to the output .obj file from running
   blender obj export (anywhere should do)
6. Finally copy the .obj file to the game resource directory for 
   models
